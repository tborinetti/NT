# FOR ME AND JONO

Dude add to this where I'm missing stuff because I 100% am

## To be implemented:

### Networking features
- need to connect two clients to one another
- a way to host IP address based on username? 
- connections might only be usable when two clients are connected 
#### Key components: 
- get user global IP address
- open port to listen for requests
- lookup other user's IP address 
- use internet to connect to desired IP address
- allow for messages to be sent
- receive messages and display on screen with timestamps
- allow for images? hosted on a server or sent byte by byte (wont be displayable in console, maybe downloaded)



### User interface
- using win32 API
- should be finished* after network connectivity - application might be difficult to test without 


### Data storage?
- hopefully immutable/encrypted files
- option to save chat ?
